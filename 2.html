when she was in her mid-20s.<br>

 many had a ‘girl show’ tent, where women danced in striptease acts. Meiselas was fascinated.

 <p>she haunted the fairgrounds, befriending dancers and sneaking backstage to capture what their lives were really like.
 She also recorded hundreds of hours of interviews. In order to blend into the crowd and get the shots she needed,
